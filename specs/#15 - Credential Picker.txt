Credential Picking Process:
1. Check for (RDP Group || rdpCpGroup field)
2. Instantiate CredentialPicker
3. Set CredentialPicker parameters (may happen with instructor at instantiation):
	rootGroup (RDP Parent || rdpCpGroup)
	recurseGroups
	excludedGroups
	regexPattern
4. CredentialPicker.GetCredential
5. Use returned Credential to invoke the connection

Credential Picker should handle the whole Process from (recursively) crawling the group-structure and matching credentials.
Over presenting the CredPicker Form to the user and selecting the credential.
It should then return a single object containing the selected credentials
Credential Picker should return 'null' for example when no credentials matching the specified regex are found so the caller can handle fallbacks
Credential Picker should ONLY handle situations which require crawling the group-structure,
i.e. when the Plugin is called on an entry neither located in the RDP group nor having the rdpCpGroup field specified, Credential Picker should not be invoked


"rdpCpRecurse = false" can't be combined with "rdpCpExcludeGroups"
